## Description

This project contains the basic set of files needed to kick-start the C++ Isometry Library challenge for C++ L1 padawans. 

The folder contains both the actual project and a development container. 

The goal of this challenge is to write a small library that enables us to determine transformations between coordinate frames in a 3D space, by defining vectors, rotation matrices and isometries to performn the transformations using regular algebrac expressions.

The devlopment container provides a development environment that has all the tools needed for the build process pre-installed. Using this container is optional but recommended, since it provides all the tools needed to build and process the project, with the correct versions needed for it.

## Project organization

The current folder has the following subfolders.

- course: Source code of the challenge.
  - include: Header files.
  - src: Source files.
  - test: Testing files.
    - gtest: GTest library source files. Do to alter these files.
    - src: Test files to check the generated code.
- docker: docker related files.

## Problem statement 

Write a small library to work with isometries. Those transformations should be able to correctly express:

- 3D composed translations and rotations.
  - From only translation vectors.
  - From only (Euler) rotation angles.
  - From composed translation vectors and rotation angles.
  - From pre-made useful constants, such as unit vector translation in x axis, etc.
- Composition of transformations.
  - Direct of a 3D coordinate in space A to space B.
  - Inverse of a 3D coordinate in space B to space A.
- IO streaming for ease of use and debugging.
- double support. → There is no need for any other data type.

The interface required for your library is defined through the test files that you will find in the test/src folder.

You will need to develop the following code abstractions to satisfy the tests:

- Vector3: Three element vector, to designate an (x, y, z) coordinate in a coordinate frame.
- Matrix3: 3x3 elements matrix, to write [rotation matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix).
- Isometry. A [homogeneus-matrix](https://www.brainvoyager.com/bv/doc/UsersGuide/CoordsAndTransforms/SpatialTransformationMatrices.html) abstraction.

We encourage you to consider using the following namespaces:

- ekumen::math
- ekumen::math::test

### Requirements

- Build an isometry tranformations matrix from from:
  - Translation vector.
  - Euler rotation angles.
  - Translation vector and Euler angles.
- Compose transformations in mathematical and semantic fashion.
- Let T be a transformation from space A to space B, and M be the transformation from space B to space A. Provide a mathematical and semantic way to obtain M from T.
- Given a point P in space A, transform it to space B with the isometry T (A → B).
- Given a point Q in space B, transform it to space A with the isometry T (A → B).
- Obtain the translation and rotation (matrix) parts from an isometry.
- Serialize to std::string a vector, a matrix and the isometry.
- Compare equality (to the type epsilon extent) of a vector, matrix and an isometry.
- Satisfy the provided unit tests of the above features.
